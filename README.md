- User-interactive menu system to select text analysis options  
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob (polarity and subjectivity)  
- Modular Python functions for clean code organization  
- Logging of analysis results to SQLite database

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python 3.x  
- TextBlob for sentiment analysis  
- SQLite for logging results  
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Usage  
1. Run the modular sentiment analyzer script:  
   ```bash
   python day1_sentiment_modular.py
